[![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg)](CHANGELOG)

A discord bot coded in `Python` for moderation and some fun.  
The bot's default command prefix is `r$`.  
discord.py version : `1.5.1`

## Downloading

```
git clone https://github.com/0xcabrex/Rexbot
cd Rexbot/
chmod +x bot.py
```

## Requirements

```
cd Rexbot/
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
OR
```
cd Rexbot/
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

You would also need a few files to run: 

- `token.0` - Contains the bot token.
- `NASA_API_KEY.0` - For the Nasa Api [key](https://api.nasa.gov/ "Get your api key here"), the `apod` command requires it.
- `mongodbclient.0` - A file that contains the url to connect to your [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com "MongoDB") cluster.  

NOTE: The files are CASE SENSITIVE, please make sure the files are named exactly as given above and put them in the same folder as the 
`bot.py` file, i.e. in the `Rexbot/` deirectory. You can also replace the `token.0`, `mongodbclient.0` and `NASA_API_KEY.0` with environment variables, but as `REXBOT_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_CLIENT_URL` and `NASA_API_KEY` respectively.  


## Running the bot

```
cd Rexbot/
./bot.py
```
OR
```
cd Rexbot/
python3 bot.py
```
